I was laying in bed the other night and the idea hit me, I have been wanting to get some blind spot mirrors for my truck as there is basically no vision out the back and I've had a few near misses with other cars next to me. I was finding it had to find some decent convex mirrors that wouldn't use up valuable mirror space and I remembered I had some motorcycle mirrors from an old project that might do the trick. They didn't take long to fit, I used some old bicycle inner tube as a spacer and a vibration dampener as my truck vibrated very violently when idling. As a bonus, these mirrors turned out to be a little bit convex as well.

The mirrors aren't out as far as I would have liked but they are fine for the moment and do the trick. In the future I might have a look at making an extension for them so they can sit out on the other side of my main mirrors.

People tell me that I hoard too much junk, but when says they need something, I'm bound to have one squirreled away somewhere.
