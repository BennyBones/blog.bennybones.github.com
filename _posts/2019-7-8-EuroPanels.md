title: Some custom Eurorack Panels
---

With my plans to make some home made modules I am going to need some face panels to go with them. Luckly I have a 3d printer and kinda know how to use TinkerCad. Here is a pair of designs I came up with for a Tik-Tak Arduino clock module and an Envelope gernerator from Look Mum No Computer.

These are both pretty simple to make and have pretty simple controls. I haven't had a chance to print them off as I am still waiting on parts to arrive to get the size for the holes right. I have plans to add a small screen to the tik-tak so I will be able to see what the clock bpm is at any given time. I'll be starting with a 4-digit 7-segment LED display just to see if it all works then I might move on to a small OLED display.

Once I have all the designs sorted and finalised I will be chucking them up onto my Thingiverse.
