title: Raspberry Pi Samplerbox Update
---
I've been using a raspberry Pi 3B+ to play samples live for a while now...
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190712_170436.jpg)

I find it works quite well compared to a few of the other sample devices I have tried using. I don't like using laptops live. Most of the time they are alright, minor lag here and there, but when they go wrong they go really wrong. I have also used an Akai MPX8. Good device but it takes forever to load the samples I use with only 16 MB of sample ram.

After touring the east coast of Australia with my little card board box enclosure I need to upgrade it. My box was destroyed while in transit from coast to coast but that is alright, it was only designed as a temporary thing. I did have my band mate fabricate a better metal enclosure but I was thinking I could design on that would work in a modular 3U case using PCBs to make it all more reliable.
