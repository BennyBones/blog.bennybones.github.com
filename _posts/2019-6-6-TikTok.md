After playing around with my limited modular synthesiser components I realised I need some way to make a clock source. Since I only have one VCO and a randomiser to make a clock and audio output, I decided making this simple project would be a good start.

On the [SM Tik Tak](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Synthemafia/modular-synth-clock-module-diy-arduino-sm-tik-tak-bd8ded) build thread there is a BOM for all the componants needed. So I jumped on to Aliexpress and ordered everything I need with enough spares to make multiple more.

| Order			| Cost	| Required | total |
| --------------------- |-------|----------|-------|
| 20 Jacks		| $3.17	| 4	   | $0.63 |
| 100 LEDs		| $1.34	| 4	   | $0.05 |
| 2 Arduino nanos 	| $5.82	| 1 	   | $2.91 |
| 20 15pin headers 	| $2.54	| 2        | $0.25 |
| 200 resistors		| $1.94	| 9	   | $0.09 |
| 5 buttons		| $1.82	| 1        | $0.36 |
| 10 5x2pin headers	| $1.31	| 1        | $0.13 |
| 10 PCB boards		| $2.80	| 1        | $0.28 |
| 6 pots with knobs	| $3.63	| 2 	   | $1.21 |
|			| $24.37 |	| $5.91 |

So for less than 6 bucks in parts I can build my own clock and get a start with understanding how Arduinos work. For the front face plate I plan to design and print something with my 3d printer, The smaller the better. Futher down the road I hope to put a small screen on it so I can see what BPM it is set to and the width of the pulse.

Other plans I have are to make some passive split panels, there are many similar designs on Thingiverse, and some simple VCOs. I am trying to teach myself Eagle so I can turn some of the schematics I have found into working PCB boards. I might even try making a PCB engraver if things go well.
