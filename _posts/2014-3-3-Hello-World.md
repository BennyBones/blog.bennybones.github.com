title: Gone Modular.
---

Over the past few months I have been attending a local modular synth workshop at the Artifactory.

I've been attending these workshops which are geared towards people interested in building modular synthesiser kits. The kits are all put together by the organisers, Nonlinear Circuits. I find building these kits have given my a much more indepth look at how they work and how the circuits are built.

So far I have 10 kits. The price ranges from around $50 to $70 depending on the kit with some being closer to $100.

I have: A power module, Divide & Conquer (signal devider), Dindubba Sequencer, Kareishuu VCO, Spasm, Dual LPG, Timbere & Timbere, The Big Room tank reverb, Mogue (mixer and VCA), and a Hyperchaos(still to be finished).

I also have plans to build a digital cv clock using an Arduino nano, the SM Tik Tak, and a rack mounted oscilliscope.
