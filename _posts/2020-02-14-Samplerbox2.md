title: Raspberry Pi Samplerbox Update
---
I've been using a raspberry Pi 3B+ to play samples live for a while now...
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/20200218.jpg)

I find it works quite well compared to a few of the other sample devices I have tried using. I don't like using laptops live. Most of the time they are alright, minor lag here and there, but when they go wrong they go really wrong. I have also used an Akai MPX8. Good device but it takes forever to load the samples I use with only 16 MB of sample ram.

After touring the east coast of Australia with my little card board box enclosure I need to upgrade it. My box was destroyed while in transit from coast to coast but that is alright, it was only designed as a temporary thing. I did have my band mate fabricate a better metal enclosure but I was thinking I could design on that would work in a modular 3U case using PCBs to make it all more reliable.

My plans to continue this build it to improve the reliablity of the actual hardware. I am planning on developing some PCB boards that will fix to the raspberry pi 3b+ and connect the power, buttons and 1602 LCD screen, maybe even the sound card, midi audio out. Making a face plate will also be on the cards for this project as I would like to either have this sampler mountable in it's own case or a eurorack scale case.

Time will tell how this project comes out as I have a number of big ideas and where to go from this but I will have to learn how to us a PCB CAD software first.
